Story: Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Mittens. Mittens was a curious and playful cat. One day, while exploring the garden, Mittens found a shiny red ball. Mittens pounced on the ball and started chasing it around the garden. The ball rolled under a bush, and Mittens had to squeeze through the branches to get it. But Mittens didn't give up. Finally, Mittens got the ball and continued to play with it. Mittens had so much fun that day, and it became Mittens' favorite toy. From then on, whenever Mittens was feeling bored, it would go and play with the shiny red ball in the garden.
